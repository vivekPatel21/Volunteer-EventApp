# Volunteer-EventApp
This is an app for Indiana University Ballroom as a way to keep track of events and volunteering.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Overview___

This is an app that I am working on in REACTJS, where Indiana University Ballroom can keep track of it's 50 members. This allows more efficient communication for thing such as events and volunteering.

## Reason___

I am working on this, because I am the head of volunteering coordinating for IU Ballroom, more specifically for the big cream and crimson event that we are hosting on October 20,2024. 
At first this was meant to be an app to help me, but now this is an app that will help IU ballroom as a whole.
